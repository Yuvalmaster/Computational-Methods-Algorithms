**The project focuses on the implementation and performance evaluation of various numerical algorithms. 
The project aims to analyze and compare the efficiency, accuracy, and convergence properties of different computational methods commonly used in 
scientific and engineering applications.** 
The following algorithms are included in the project:

- AdamBashforth Algorithm
The AdamBashforth algorithm is a numerical integration method used for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). 
It is an explicit multi-step method that approximates the solution at a given time step based on previous solution values and their derivatives.

- Bisection Algorithm
The Bisection algorithm is a root-finding method used to find the roots of a continuous function. 
It is an iterative approach that repeatedly bisects an interval and narrows down the range in which the root exists until a desired level of accuracy is achieved.

- Fixed Point Algorithm
The Fixed Point algorithm is an iterative method used to find the fixed points of a given function. 
It involves repeatedly applying the function to an initial guess until convergence to a fixed point is achieved.

- Gauss Seidel Algorithm
The Gauss Seidel algorithm is an iterative method for solving systems of linear equations. 
It updates the solution iteratively by considering the most recently computed values, providing a more efficient approach compared to the Gauss-Jordan elimination method.

- Henstenes Steifel Algorithm
The Henstenes Steifel algorithm is an iterative method used for solving systems of linear equations. 
It combines ideas from the Gauss Seidel and conjugate gradient methods to achieve faster convergence and improved stability.

- Jacobi Algorithm
The Jacobi algorithm is an iterative method for solving systems of linear equations. 
It updates the solution iteratively by using the previous iteration's values, making it a simple and widely used method for solving large linear systems.

- Newton Raphson Algorithm
The Newton Raphson algorithm is a root-finding method used to find the roots of a differentiable function. 
It iteratively refines an initial guess by using the function's value and derivative, converging to the root with quadratic convergence rate under certain conditions.

- Predictor Corrector Algorithm
The Predictor Corrector algorithm is a numerical integration method used for solving ordinary differential equations. 
It combines the predictions from a lower-order method (predictor) and the corrections from a higher-order method (corrector) to improve accuracy and stability.

- QR Factorization Algorithm
The QR Factorization algorithm is a numerical method used for decomposing a matrix into the product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix. 
It is widely used in solving linear least squares problems and eigenvalue computations.

- Runge Kutta Algorithm
The Runge Kutta algorithm is a numerical method used for solving ordinary differential equations. 
It is an explicit multi-stage method that estimates the solution at each time step by considering weighted averages of function evaluations at multiple points within the time interval.

- SOR Algorithm
The SOR (Successive Over-Relaxation) algorithm is an iterative method used for solving systems of linear equations. 
It improves upon the Gauss Seidel method by introducing an additional relaxation parameter that accelerates convergence.

- Secant Algorithm
The Secant algorithm is a root-finding method used to find the roots of a continuous function. 
It is similar to the Bisection algorithm but employs a secant line between two points instead of bisecting intervals.

- Taylor Algorithm
The Taylor algorithm is a numerical method used for approximating functions by expanding them into a Taylor series. 
It provides a polynomial representation of the function, enabling accurate approximations for a given range of inputs.
